{"name":"Science Toolbox","tagline":"12th Grade project ","body":"### School Project\r\nProject was recently renamed from Science Database to Science _Toolbox_. This is a **12th grade project** by three students in Sri Kumarans Childrens Home .(Honestly just two, Raj just tagged along)\r\n\r\n### Science Toolbox \r\n![Science](http://wallsroyal.com/thumbs/art-design/minimalistic-science-simplistic-symbols-2775179-480x320.jpg)\r\nThis project is built using **_c++_** and _**graphics.h**_ \r\n````c++\r\n#include <iostream> \r\n#include <graphics.h>\r\n#include <math.h>\r\n.....\r\n``` \r\n(:sparkles: i know its old but still :sparkles:). This project includes a **Light Simulator**, **Linear Grapher** and an **Organic Compound Namer**.\r\n\r\n### Compound Namer:\r\nCan name straight chain compounds from 1-10 c-atoms and various substituent groups.Completly integrated in graphics window.\r\n\r\n###Light Simulator:\r\nSimulates propagation of light in medium along with reflection of light against convex and concave mirror with lines indicating light. Output in both command line and graphics window.\r\n\r\n###Linear Grapher:\r\nGraphs linear equations of form y=mx+c. Output in both command line and graphics window.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n > - Sushant S Rao(@TriggerHappyBunnies), Aakash Hegde(@Aero) and Raj US.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact us at _**sushant.rao@outlook.com**_ or _**hegdeaakash@gmail.com**_ or **_raj.subramanian21@gmail.com_**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
