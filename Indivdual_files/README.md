## Bugs
#### In Compound Namer: 
Menu system faulty in substituent choosing menu.
Aldehyde only in last and first C-atom.
When naming primary ketone even aldehyde gets included.
Make more user friendly.
#### In Light Simulator:
Restrict focal length so that reflection does not look faulty.
#### In Linear Grapher:
Number X and Y axis and say x and y axis at the ends.
Maybe do sin and cos curves in the form sin (nx+c) and cos (nx+c) in radians.
Make more good looking overall

#### Do all these in school.
#### Properly indent everything in sublime.
